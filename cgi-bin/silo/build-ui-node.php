/* Specialised version of build_node for handling the extra meta data
 * associated with UI elements.
 * Arg data: the assoc array of meta data for a group of elements
 * Arg node_key: the type of UI node being made
 * Arg defaults: default attribute values applied if nothing else is
 * Arg overrides: attributes to replace the ones found in the normal
 *      processing of the node meta data
 * Arg prefix_id: a prefix applied to HTML id attributes within menus
 * Arg extra_attribs: attributes to apply to the node which are set by
 *      the calling function rather than the meta data configured for
 *      the node. Applied to the meta data after all other merges are
 *      completed, and in the same manner as used in collect_meta
 *
 * Return: list of strings
 *      HTML opening tag
 *      flattened list of node content (if not a self-closing tag)
 *      HTML closing tag (if not a self-closing tag)
