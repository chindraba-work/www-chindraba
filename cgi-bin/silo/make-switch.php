/* Create a checkbox or radio button, hidden, which serves as the

 * Arg switch_data: the un-collapsed meta data for the group the switch
 *      is in. See cgi-bin/docs/metadata.php for a full description.
 * Arg is_close: set to true to create a close switch for cases where
 *      a separate switch is needed for opening (adding) and closing
 *      (removing) a section of HTML.
 * Return: list of HTML strings to add to the rendered page
 *
 * Conceptually every switch should be tied to a trigger, or triggers,
 * which are displayed to the user. Activating the trigger changes the
 * state of the switch, whose state is used within the CSS to change
 * the presentation of some element, or group of elements.
