    <p>There is a long tradition in programming languages that your first program in any language should simply say "Hello World!" and do nothing else.</p>
    <p>There is actually a very good practical reason for this habit. <code>Hello World</code> is the Simplest possible program you can write that you can prove works. <code>Hello World</code> programs are use to help you figure out the mechanics of the progamming environment &mdash; how the program is written, what special steps you have to do to make the code run, and how it works.</p>
    <p> There is no point in making a complicated program until you know you can get the code to pop up and say "hi."</p>
